# Malware Samples Repository

## `** Download these at your own risk. I am not responsible if your system gets infected or breaks because you downloaded and ran one of the samples in a production or live environment. **`

### Description

This repository is a collection of malware samples that I have come across in the wild. I plan on analyzing these on my own to sharpen my malware analysis skills.

` Note: I won't be providing information on setting up an environment for analysis. There are plenty of other (more knowledgeable) people than me that provide information on tools and tips for analyzing malware samples. `
